To count how many times each learner_surname appears in the learner table,
you can use the GROUP BY clause along with the COUNT function.

SELECT learner_surname, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM learner
GROUP BY learner_surname;

-----------------------------------------------
To calculate the age of each learner based on the learner_dob column in SQL,
you can use the DATEDIFF function along with some date functions.

SELECT learner_id, learner_name, learner_surname,
       FLOOR(DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), learner_dob) / 365.25) AS age
FROM learner;

---------------------------------------------------------------
To count how many learners are of each age,
you can use the query to calculate the age and then group the results by age.

SELECT
    FLOOR(DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), learner_dob) / 365.25) AS age,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM learner
GROUP BY age
ORDER BY age;
